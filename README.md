# FriendFinder
This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. The full-stack site will take in results from a users' survey, then compares the answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

This application uses Express to handle routing and is deloyed on Heroku.
